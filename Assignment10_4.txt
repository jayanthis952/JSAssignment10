a) The output of the program will be:
Hello John
Hello Tina
Hello Kale
Hello Max

b) The higher order function in this example is the useFunction 
function because it takes another function (fn) as an argument and 
uses it to perform some operation on each element of the arr array. 
This is the definition of a higher order function - 
a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. 
In this case, the useFunction function is passing the argFn function as an argument 
and using it to print a greeting for each name in the names array.
